The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to
say on the subject of towels.
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great
practical value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as
you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it
beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy
river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to- hand-combat; wrap it
round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the
gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a
mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't
see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very
ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a
distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if
it still seems to be clean enough.  More importantly, a
towel has immense psychological value.  For some reason, if
a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch
hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume
that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel,
soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string,
gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch
hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch
hiker might accidentally have "lost".  What the strag will
think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth
of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible
odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is
clearly a man to be reckoned with.
