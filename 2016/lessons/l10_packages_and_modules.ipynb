As such, the first module we will consider is NumPy. We will talk a **lot** more about NumPy later in the bootcamp."

We'll have a function `rna()`, which converts a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence (just changes `T` to `U`), and another function `reverse_rna_complement()`, which returns the reverse RNA complement of a DNA template.

To allow for this, you should set your `$PYTHONPATH` **environment variable**. This tells Python/IPython where to look for your modules. `conda` takes care of this for you for anything managed with `conda`, but obviously not for your own packages. In the next lesson, you will set up a directory for your bootcamp files with the path `~/git/bootcamp/`.
