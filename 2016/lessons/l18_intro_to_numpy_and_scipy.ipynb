NumPy is part of the [**SciPy stack**](http://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html), a collection of packages for doing various scientific computations. Most of the SciPy stack is built on NumPy and its poweful `ndarray` data type.

This means that the Python interpreter reads through your code, line by line, translates the commands into instructions that your computer's processor can execute, and then these are executed.  As an interpreted language, code is often much easier to write, and development time is much shorter.  It is often easier to debug.  By contrast, with **compiled languages** (the dominant ones being Fortran, C, and C++), your entire source code is translated into machine code before you ever run it.  When you execute your program, it is already in machine code.  As a result, compiled code is often much faster than interpreted code.  The speed difference depends largely on the task at hand, but there is usually over a 100 to 1000-fold difference.\n",

(They are usually C or Fortran functions.)  That means that you get to use an interpreted language with near-compiled speed!  We can demonstrate the speed by comparing an explicit sum of elements of an array using a Python **`for`** loop versus NumPy.  We will use the `np.random` module to generate a large array of random numbers (we will visit random number generation in a coming lesson).

    "If you are writing code and you think to yourself, \"This seems like a pretty common things to do,\" there is a good chance the someone really smart has written code to do it.  If it's something numerical, there is a good chance it is in NumPy or SciPy.  **Use these packages.** Do not reinvent the wheel.  It is very rare you can beat them for performance, error checking, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, NumPy and SciPy are very well unit tested (we will discuss this in the [Test Driven Development](l35_testing_and_tdd.html) lesson).  In general, you do not need to write unit tests for well-established packages.  Obviously, if you use NumPy or SciPy within your own functions, you still need to unit test what you wrote."
