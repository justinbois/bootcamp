    "In addition to his tidy data paper, Hadley Wickham also wrote an [influential paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v040i01/v40i01.pdf) on the **split-apply-combine** idea. To quote him, \"You see the split-apply-combine strategy whenever you break up a big problem into manageable pieces, operate on each piece independently and then put all the pieces back together.\" An example of a split-apply-combine operation on our present data set is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split** the data up into four groups, one for each of the four frogs.\n",
    "2. Compute the mean impact force for each frog. Here, we are **apply**ing the mean function to the split data.\n",
    "3. **Combine** the results into a new set of four data points containing the mean impact force of each frog.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine that split-apply-combine operations happy very often in analyzing biological data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `groupby()` method of Pandas enables convenient split-apply-combine. It works by splitting up a `DataFrame` based on some criterion. Once that happens, we can then apply a function to these split up `DataFrame`. Upon application of the function, we get a recombined `DataFrame` with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is best shown by example. We'll compute mean impact force of each frog. First, though, let's do it the \"long way.\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Extract all of Frog I's impact forces and compute the mean.\n",
    "2. Do the same for the other three frogs.\n",
    "3. Write a `for` loop to do this and return a NumPy array with the four mean impact forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we can actually do it with a list comprehension in one line, but you can imagine such operations can get clunky in a hurry."
