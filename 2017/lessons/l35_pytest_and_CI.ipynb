    "To explore another feature of `pytest`, we'll consider another aspect of our `n_neg()` function.  Specifically, what should we do if an invalid sequence is entered?\n",
    "\n",
    "A sensible thing to do in this case is to make our software *throw* a `RuntimeError`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, in designing our test, we need to think about what constitutes an invalid sequence.  We'll only allow the 20 symbols for the residues that we used in [previous lessons](l15_exceptions_and_error_handling.html#Checking-input) and present in the `bioinfo_dicts.py` module.  So, we adjust our test function accordingly.  We cannot use the **`assert`** statement to check for proper error handling, so we use the `pytest.raises()` function.  This function takes as its first argument the type of exception expected, and a string containing the code to be run to give the exception."

To make sure your code is up to snuff, the software community developed the concepts around unit testing and to facilitate collaborative work they developed git. **CI** is the combination of the two... continuously.\n",
