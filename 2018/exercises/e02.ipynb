If a given residue has a dissociation constant $K_a$ and in a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of [H$^+$], then the fraction $f$ of residues that are deprotonated is\n",

You want a function with signature `net_charge(seq, pH=7)` that returns the equilibrium net charge of the sequence.\n",
