    "Keeping track of all of the changes in your project over time is good practice. How many times have you edited something in something you were writing and then wanted to go back and see what you had in the first place? Wouldn't it be great to know what changes you made and when you made them?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **version control system** facilitates this process of keeping track of changes over time. Beyond that, it allows multiple people to collaborate and work on parts of the same project simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many version control systems. The four most prominent, in order of age, oldest to youngest, are CVS, Subversion, Git, and Mercurial (the first version of Git was released about two weeks before Mercurial, so they are really the same age). Today, Git dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the person who developed the Linux operating system. He named Linux after himself, and he decided to also name Git after himself (\"git\" is British slang for a stupid person). Try typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    man git\n",
    "    \n",
    "on the command line and read what the `NAME` of the software is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Git as a version control system allows communication with remote repositories such as [GitHub](http://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). Both services provide university-affiliated people with a `.edu` email address with perks that include free private repositories. We will use GitHub for our bootcamp, and you should already have set up an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories are not only a great way for keeping your data safe. They are also an excellent tool for collaboration since Git allows multiple users to edit the shared files simultaneously and has a method to merge changes afterwards.  Public repositories can also serve as a vehicle to distribute code (or other files).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/documentation). It is well documented. Here is an [excellent one-page (front-and-back) cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started. You all should have a version of Git installed on your computers. Open the terminal and navigate into your `~/git` directory."

We will do the configuration with `--global` flags, which means these specifications work for all of your repositories. First, we'll specify the name and email address of the person working with Git on your machine (that's you!).\n",

    "You have already cloned the `bootcamp` repository in [lesson 0](l00_configuring_your_machine.html). We'll practice that again here, and clone one of the zillions of public repositories that are hosted on GitHub. We will clone a simple package, called `insulter` that will hurl Shakespearean insults at you.\n",

    "## Pulling in changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Actively developed repositories are constantly being updated. After you clone the repository, its authors may add or edit things in the repository. For you to get those changes, you need to **fetch** them and then **merge** them into what you have locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fetch the updated repository, you guessed it, you do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git fetch\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is stored in a hidden directory, `.git/FETCH_HEAD`. (Directories that begin with a `.` are hidden; you don't see them when you type `ls`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that there are changes, you would like to update your local repository. Provided you do not have any local edits, this is seamless. You just do\n",
    "\n",
    "    git merge FETCH_HEAD\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now your repository will be up to date.\n",
    "\n",

    "    git pull\n",
    "    \n",
    "In practice, you will use this a lot, but, as you will see, we will use fetching and merging on a forked repository in the next lesson, so it can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try doing this with the `bootcamp` repository. `cd` into `~/git/bootcamp/`. Now, type\n",
    "\n",
    "    git pull\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will \"pull\" in any changes make to the repository. Throughout the bootcamp, we may need to update files in the repository, so you may need to `git pull` throughout the bootcamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `git pull` is actually shorthand for \n",
    "\n",
    "    git pull origin master\n",
    "    \n",
    "which is the more verbose way of saying that you want to pull the master **branch** from the remote repository named `origin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally it is good practice to pull before you start working each day to make sure you pull in any updates your collaborators may have made."

    "\n",
    "Now, you will create your own repository for practice. We will call the repository `bootcamp_utils`. We have already made the repository in the last lesson. Actually, because there are some other goodies in there we may use later, you should copy it from `~/git/bootcamp/modules/`. We are using this as an example of how you can put packages under version control, and you can add to it if you like for your own use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only in rare circumstances would you not want to host your repository remotely, so we will take an easy path toward creating a repository using GitHub. Prior to the bootcamp, you all should have set up a GitHub account. Log in to GitHub. In the upper right corner of the page, click on the \"**`+`**\" icon and select \"New repository.\" You will then get a page that looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "I have checked the box to initialized the repository with a README. This is convenient because GitHub will set up the repository and populate it with a README file that you can generate right in your browser. I also selected to add a Python `.gitignore`, which is convenient for keeping your version control clean (more on that [later](#.gitignore)). Finally, I chose an MIT license, which is a liberal license that will let others use your code if they would like to. \n",
    "\n",
    "After clicking \"Create repository,\" you will get a page that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![github3.png](github3.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, it is time to clone your repository on your own machine. I think you know the drill. First, `cd` to your `~/git` directory (if that is where you choose to keep your repositories). Then do this:\n",

    "    git clone the_url_you_just_copied\n",
