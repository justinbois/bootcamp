    "We are at an interesting point in Python's history.  Python is currently in version 3.6 (as of June 1, 2017). The problem is that Python 3.x is not backwards compatible with Python 2.x. Many scientific packages were written in Python 2.x and have been very slow to update to Python 3. However, Python 3 is Python's present and future, so all packages eventually need to work in Python 3. Today, most important scientific packages work in Python 3 (and some now *only* in Python 3). All of the packages we will use do, so we will use Python 3 in this course."

We will primarily be using conda to install and update packages.\n",

They may even be some downgrades.

    "We will be using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for most of our plotting. By default, Altair only exports graphics as PNG and HTML (which is really all you need, at least for sharing plots and for the **paper of the future**, which is not a PDF and is interactive). However, many of us are still publishing the paper of the present, which is typically a PDF, and we want **vector graphics** for our plots. To enable Altair to publish vector graphics, you will need to install the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) web browser and [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org). To install Chrome, simply [download it](https://www.google.com/chrome) and follow the on-screen instructions. You do not need to make it your default browser if you do not want to. To install ChromeDriver, download the [most recent ZIPped binary](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (choose the zip file that matches your operating system). Unzip it, and save the binary to a directory in your `PATH`. (If you don't know what `PATH` means, it's ok; we'll cover is in [Lesson 2](l02_basic_command_line_skills.html).) If you're using macOS or Linux, you can do the following on the command line, assuming you saved the unzipped file in the `Downloads/` folder in your home directory.\n",

Not all of the packages are in the default channel of conda, so we will instruct conda to look in the `conda-forge` and `bioconda` channels as well as the `defaults` channel. To do this, execute the following on the command line.\n",
