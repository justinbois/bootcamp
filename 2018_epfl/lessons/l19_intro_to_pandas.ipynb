    "Throughout your research career, you will undoubtedly need to handle data, possibly lots of data.  The data comes in lots of formats, and you will spend much of your time **wrangling** the data to get it into a usable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is the primary tool in the SciPy stack for handling data.  Its primary object, the `DataFrame` is extremely useful in wrangling data.  We will explore some of that functionality here, and will put it to use in the next lesson."

    "## The data set\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore using Pandas with a real data set. We will use a data set published in [Beattie, et al., Perceptual impairment in face identification with poor sleep, *Royal Society Open Science*, **3**, 160321, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160321). In this paper, researchers used the [Glasgow Factial Matching Test](https://doi.org/10.3758/BRM.42.1.286) (GMFT) to investigate how sleep deprivation affects a subject's ability to match faces, as well as the confidence the subject has in those matches. Briefly, the test works by having subjects look at a pair of faces. Two such pairs are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"gfmt_faces.png\" alt=\"gfmt_faces.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The top two pictures are the same person, the bottom two pictures are different people. For each pair of faces, the subject gets as much time as he or she needs and then says whether or not they are the same person. The subject then rates his or her confidence in the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, subjects also took surveys to determine properties about their sleep. The Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI) is a measure of insomnia disorder over the past month (scores of 16 and below indicate insomnia). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) quantifies how well a subject sleeps in terms of interruptions, latency, etc. A higher score indicates poorer sleep. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assesses daytime drowsiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is stored in the file `~/git/bootcamp/data/gfmt_sleep.csv`. The contents of this file were adapted from [the Excel file posted on the public Dryad repository](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r620r). (Note this: if you want other people to use and explore your data, make it publicly available.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **CSV file**, where CSV stands for comma-separated value. This is a text file that is easily read into data structures in many programming languages. You should generally always store your data in such a format, not necessarily CSV, but a format that is open, has a well-defined specification, and is readable in many contexts. Excel files do not meet these criteria. Neither to `.mat` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the CSV file."

    "The first line contains the **headers** for each column. They are participant number, gender, age, etc. The data follow. There are two important things to note here. First, notice that the `gender` column has string data (`m` or `f`), while the rest of the data are numeric. Note also that there are some **missing data**, denoted by the `*`s in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the file I/O skills you recently learned, you could write some functions to parse this file and extra the data you want. You can imagine that this might be kind of painful. However, if the file format is nice and clean, like we more or less have here, we can use pre-built tools. Pandas has a very powerful function, `pd.read_csv()` that can read in a CSV file and store the contents in a convenient data structure called a `DataFrame`."
