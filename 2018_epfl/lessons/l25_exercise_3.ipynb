    "\n",
    "[Peter and Rosemary Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant) have been working on the Galápagos island of Daphne Major for over forty years.  During this time, they have collected lots and lots of data about physiological features of finches.  In 2014, they published a book with a summary of some of their major results (Grant P. R., Grant B. R., *40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island*, Princeton University Press, 2014). They made their data from the book publicly available via the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6g3h).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate their measurements of beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) and beak length (base to tip on the top) of Darwin's finches.  We will look at data from two species, *Geospiza fortis* and *Geospiza scandens*.  The Grants provided data on the finches of Daphne for the years 1973, 1975, 1987, 1991, and 2012.  I have included the data in the files `grant_1973.csv`, `grant_1975.csv`, `grant_1987.csv`, `grant_1991.csv`, and  `grant_2012.csv`. They are in almost exactly the same format is in the Dryad repository; I have only deleted blank entries at the end of the files.\n",

My opinion is that you should drop duplicate birds from the same year and keep the others, but I would be open to discussion on that.  To practice your Pandas skills, though, let's delete only duplicate birds from the same year from the `DataFrame`.  When you have made this `DataFrame`, save it as a CSV file.\n",

Since the indices are uninformative, you should use the `index=False` kwarg.

    "The Anderson-Fisher data set is a famous data set collected by Edgar Anderson and promoted by Ronald Fisher for use in [his technique of linear discriminant analysis in taxonometric problems](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x). The data set is now a classic data set that is used in data analysis. In this problem, you will explore this data set and ways of looking at it with Pandas/Altair.  The data set is available in `~/data/fisher_iris.csv`.\n",

    "**a)** Generate a [dash-dot plot](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/dot_dash_plot.html#dot-dash-plot) of the petal width versus petal length. Why might this be a good way of visualizing this kind of data set?\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Generate a [matrix plot](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_matrix.html#scatter-matrix) of this data set. What are the advantages of this kind of plot?\n",
