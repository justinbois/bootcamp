    "\n",
    "A **shell** is a program that takes commands from files or entered interactively through the keyboard and passes them on to the operating system to be executed. A shell is accessed through a **terminal** or **terminal emulator**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use JupyterLab's terminal in this tutorial and throughout most of the bootcamp. However, you need not limit yourself to using this. If you are using macOS, you can use the Terminal application. For a Mac, you can fire up the Terminal application. It is typically in the `/Applications/Utilities` folder. Otherwise, hit ⌘-space bar and type `terminal` in the search box, and select the Terminal Application. For Windows, you can use PowerShell, which you can launch through the `Start` menu. If you are using Linux, it's a good bet you already know how to navigate a terminal, so we will not give specific instructions for Linux. "

    "## A very brief historical overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Thompson of Bell Labs developed the predecessor to the modern shell for the first release of UNIX in 1971. In 1977, Stephen Bourne introduced the Bourne shell (`sh`) which added the ability to invoke scripts (small reusable programs) from within the shell. The Bourne shell remains relevant. In some cases it is still the default root shell. Shortly afterwards, the C shell (`csh`) was developed which made use of a C-like scripting language. `tcsh` is built on `csh` and is still very common. `bash`, the Bourne again shell was developed by Brian Fox to replace the Bourne shell. It adds many useful features to sh and is the default shell for macOS and several Linux distributions. "

We will not use `bash` for Windows users in the bootcamp (unless you want to), but will instead use [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), which is also the default shell in JupyterLab's terminal for Windows users. For the simple command line operations we will do in the bootcamp, PowerShell is almost always sufficient and the syntax is the same.

Since it doesn't require the whole file to be read before displaying the top content, it's ideal for larger files. It also supports searching initiated by \"/\" followed by the query; `shift+g` will go to the end of the file; `gg` to the beginning; and you can specify a line number by \"`:`\" followed by the line number.\n",
