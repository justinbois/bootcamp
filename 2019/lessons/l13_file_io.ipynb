In this tutorial, we will learn about some of Python's File I/O capabilities. We will use a PDB file as an example. The PDB file contains the crystal structure for the tetramerization domain of [p53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53). It is stored in the  file `~git/bootcamp/data/1OLG.pdb`. (Make sure you launch your notebook from the `~git/bootcamp/` directory.) Note that `1OLG` is its unique [Protein Databank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1olg) identifier."
