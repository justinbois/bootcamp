    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to plot your data with a logarithmic scale. As an example, let's consider the classic genetic switch engineered by Jim Collins and coworkers ([Gardner, et al., *Nature*, **403**, 339, 2000](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6767/full/403339a0.html)). This genetic switch was incorporated into *E. coli* and is inducible by adjusting the concentration of the lactose analog IPTG. The readout is the fluorescence intensity of GFP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load in some data that have the IPTG concentrations and GFP fluorescence intensity. The data are in the file `~/git/data/collins_switch.csv`. Let's look at it."

Then, Column 1 is the IPTG concentration, column 2 is the normalized GFP expression level, and the last column is the standard error of the mean normalized GFP intensity. This gives the error bars, which we will look at in the next exercise. For now, we will just plot IPTG versus normalized GFP intensity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you have done that, there are some problems with the plot. It is really hard to see the data points with low concentrations of IPTG. In fact, looking at the data set, the concentration of IPTG varies over four orders of magnitude. When you have data like this, it is wise to plot them on a logarithmic scale. You can specify the x-axis as logarithmic when you instantiate a figure with `bokeh.plotting.figure()` by using the `x_axis_type='log'` kwarg. (The obvious analogous kwarg applied for the y-axis.) For this data set, it is definitely best to have the x-axis on a logarithmic scale. Remake the plot you just did with the x-axis logarithmically scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make the x-axis logarithmically scaled, you will notice the Bokeh's formatting for the tick labels is pretty awful. Fixing this is a surprisingly difficult problem, and many plotting packages do not make pretty superscripts."

You should base the values in these columns on the standard error of the mean (`sem`). Assuming a Gaussian model, the 95% confidence interval is ±1.96 times the s.e.m.\n",
