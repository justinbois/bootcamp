Specifically, we use `re.finditer()` to automatically find all occurrences of the recognition sequence in the sequence, and then use the `start()` method to get the first index."

    "Mostly, these match exactly the listed values, except each index reported by our function is one less than the listed values because we are indexing starting at zero. The one example that is different from the data sheet is that the data sheet does not contain the cut site at index 37583. This could be because NEB made a mistake either in the sequencing or in determining their cut sites, or because they validated the cut sites experimentally, and for some reason there is some strange structure around that cut site that precludes cutting. It could also be that because there is only a short fragment of DNA between the cut site at 37458 and the one they missed at 37583 that is it missed in a gel electrophoresis assay.\n",

However, as [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) said, \"The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; **premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.**\" Get your code working, even if it is slow, and optimize only if you have to."
