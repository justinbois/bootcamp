    "At the dawn of the molecular revolution in biology, key experiments by Jacques Monod in which he measured growth curves of bacteria under different conditions exposed some of the mechanisms of regulation of gene expression. Those growth curves were measured in a bulk solution. In this exercise, we will measure bacterial growth starting from *two bacteria*. The movie shows *Bacillus subtilis* constitutively expressing mCherry growing under slow growth conditions. These data were kindly donated by Jin Park from the [Elowitz lab](http://www.elowitz.caltech.edu) at Caltech.\n",

Alternatively, you can fit the exponential function directly using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit()`. Once you find the growth rate (and intercept), plot the theoretical growth curve along with the data."
