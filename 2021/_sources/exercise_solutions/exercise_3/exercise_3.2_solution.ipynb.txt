This is most easily accomplished using the `re` module that uses **[regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)**, which we will cover in an auxiliary lesson. Specifically, we use `re.finditer()` to automatically find all occurrences of the recognition sequence in the sequence, and then use the `start()` method to get the first index."

    "Mostly, these match exactly the listed values, except each index reported by our function is one less than the listed values because we are indexing starting at zero. The one example that is different is that the file we are comparing to does not contain the cut site at index 37583. According to the [restriction map from NEB](https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/page-images/tools-and-resources/interactive-tools/dna-sequences-and-maps/lambda_map.pdf), NEB sells λ DNA that is a derivative of the strain λ cI857ind1 Sam7. This particular strain has a point mutation in the cI gene. Coincidentally, the point mutation results in an extra HindIII site at 37583. Note that this site is very close to the site at 37458, which means that you might not see the resulting short fragment of DNA between those two sites in a gel, since you might run that fragment off the gel.\n",
