Compile languages tend to be more verbose including requiring more direct instructions about how to allocate and free memory. They tend to be more low-level; you need more lines of code to do the same task compared to **dynamic languages** like Python, in which the code is interpreted (translated) into machine code as you run, and the interpreter handles a lot of the memory allocation and deallocation automatically behind the scenes.\n",
