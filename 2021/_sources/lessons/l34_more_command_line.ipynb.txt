First, `cat sequences/*.fasta` outputs the entire text of all files in the directory `sequences` that have the `.fasta` suffix. That is piped to `grep`, meaning that the output of the `cat` command does not go to the screen, but to `grep`. So, we now take all that text from those files and use `grep` to give all lines that start with `>`. Those lines are then piped into `wc`, which, with the `-l` flag, gives the number of lines. Thus, we get a count of the total number of sequences in our FASTA files. Pretty slick!"
