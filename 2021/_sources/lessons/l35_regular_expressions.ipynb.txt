    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying theory of regexes dates back to 1956. It was developed by Stephen Cole Kleene as part of theoretical computer science's attempt to describe a regular language. In the late 60's and early 70's regexes got broader attention as they could be used in lexical analysis of compilers and in pattern matching of text editors such as `ed`. Executing the latter function is synonymous to employing `Ctrl+F` or `Command+F` today to search a document for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are in itself a very specialized and compact programing language that can be employed straight away in a number of command line tools such as `awk`, `sed`, and `grep`. Higher level programming languages such as Perl and Python employ a slightly modified version. To use them in Python we need to import the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to see how regexes are used in Python let's first have a look at a simple example of regexes at work:\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `data/towels.txt` contains some relevant information regarding towels. We will use the `grep` on the command line to print lines that match a regular expression. The syntax for grep is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    grep \"some search string\" some_file.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "(The name grep is inspired by the command `g/re/p`, globular search/regular expression/print)\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all a quick look at the text file. For this we use `cat`."
