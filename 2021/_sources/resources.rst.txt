Scientific Python distribution
------------------------------

We will be using the `Anaconda Python
distribution <https://www.anaconda.com>`__, which can be `downloaded
here <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`__. We will use Python 3.8, so
*make sure you download and install that version*.


Online instruction
------------------

Free instructional materials abound. Below are some resources to help
you learn programming principles using Python.

-  `Think Python <https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/>`__, by
   Allen Downey. While we do not have a formal textbook, much of our
   philosophy in the bootcamp is based on this book. It is available for
   free as a PDF, or you can buy a hard copy from Amazon.
-  `A Whirlwind Tour of
   Python <http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf>`__
   (see also the `git
   repo <https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython>`__), by Jake
   Vanderplas. This is a great overview of the Python language and
   covers much of what we do in the first day and a half of bootcamp.
   You will be hard pressed to find someone who can explain programming
   and analysis basics better then Jake Vanderplas.
-  `Codecademy <https://www.codecademy.com>`__ Offers browser-based
   interactive coding courses in a variety of languages, including
   Python. Their courses on `learning the command
   line <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>`__,
   `learning git <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git>`__, and of
   course `learning
   Python <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3>`__ are
   probably most useful for you for the bootcamp.
-  `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`__, by
   Zed Shaw. Zed has written several books in his tutorials Learn *Code*
   the Hard Way. As he explains, "the hard way," in which you hand-type
   everything you are learning, is actually easy. Zed is quite
   opinionated (but backs up his opinions), and some things he suggests
   might be different from what we do in class (using Python 3 in
   particular; he uses Python 2). Specifically, his `crash course on the
   command
   line <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html>`__ will
   be useful to you.
-  `Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>`__ is a great
   organization that teaches coding practices to beginners with many
   `lessons <https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/>`__. Of particular
   value to you in the context of our bootcamp are their lessons on the
   `Unix shell <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice>`__, `version
   control with Git <http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`__, and
   of course
   `Python <http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation>`__.
-  `Exploratory computing with
   Python <http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/>`__,
   by Mark Bakker. This is a nice set of Jupyter notebooks that help you
   learn some of the basics of scientific computing with Python.

Books
-----

Below are books we have found useful in learning Python and preparing
for the bootcamp.

-  `Think Python <https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/>`__, by
   Allen Downey, which is mentioned above.
-  `Computing for Biologists: Python Programming and
   Principles <http://www.amazon.com/Computing-Biologists-Python-Programming-Principles/dp/1107642183>`__,
   by Libeskind-Hadas and Bush, is an introductory programming book
   written specifically for biologists. Some of the examples in the
   bootcamp are inspired by this book.
-  `Python Essential Reference (4th
   Ed) <http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-David-Beazley/dp/0672329786>`__,
   by David Beazley. This is a long and quite complete reference. It is
   also very clearly written. If you are going to be doing more
   programming in Python in the future, this is a good book to have on
   your desk.
- `Python Distilled <http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-David-Beazley/dp/0672329786>`__, by David Beazley. This is not yet released, but given Beazley's other work, it promises to be a valuable reference, focusing on the essentials of the language.
-  `Fluent
   Python <https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming-dp-1492056359/dp/1492056359/ref=dp_ob_title_bk>`__,
   by Luciano Ramalho. This is a book to help you hone your Python
   skills and help you become a Pythonista. It covers more advanced
   programming techniques than we do in the bootcamp.
