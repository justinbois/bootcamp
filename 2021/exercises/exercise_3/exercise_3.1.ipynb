    "There are packages, like [Biopython](http://biopython.org/) and [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org) for processing files you encounter in bioinformatics. In this problem, though, we will work on our file I/O skills.  \n",

    "**a)** Use command line tools to investigate the [FASTA file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) located at `~git/bootcamp/data/salmonella_spi1_region.fna`. This file contains a portion of the _Salmonella_ genome (described in [Exercise 4.1](exercise_4.1.ipynb)).\n",

    "\n",
    "**b)** The format of the _Salmonella_ SPI1 region FASTA file is a common format for such files (though oftentimes FASTA files contain multiple sequences). Use the file I/O skills you have learned to write a function to read in a sequence from a FASTA file containing a single sequence (but possibly having the first line in the file beginning with `>`). Your function should take as input the name of the FASTA file and return two strings. First, it should return the descriptor string (which starts with `>`). Second, it should return a string with no gaps containing the sequence.\n",
