    "Neonicotinoid pesticides are thought to have inadvertent effects on service-providing insects such as bees. A study of this was [featured in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/science/neonicotinoid-insecticide-bee-sperm.html) in 2016. The original paper is [Straub, et al.,  Proc. Royal Soc. B 283(1835): 20160506](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2016.0506). Straub and coworkers put their [data in the Dryad repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bs515), which means we can work with it!\n",

    "We will look at the weight of drones (male bees) using the data set stored in `~/git/bootcamp/data/bee_weight.csv` and the sperm quality of drone bees using the data set stored in `~/git/bootcamp/data/bee_sperm.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Load the drone weight data in as a Pandas `DataFrame`.  Note that the unit of the weight is milligrams (mg).\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Plot ECDFs of the drone weight for control and also for those exposed to pesticide. Do you think there is a clear difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** Repeat parts (a) and (b) for drone sperm. Use the `'Quality'` column as your measure. This is defined as the percent of sperm that are alive in a 500 µL sample.\n",

    "**d)** Make any other plots you may think are interesting or enlightening."
