    "Reading data in from files and then writing your results out again is one of the most common practices in scientific computing. In this tutorial, we will learn about some of Python's File I/O capabilities. We will use a PDB file as an example. The PDB file contains the crystal structure for the tetramerization domain of [p53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53).It is stored in the  file `~/git/bootcamp/data/1OLG.pdb`. (Make sure you launch your notebook from the `~/git/bootcamp/` directory.) Note that `1OLG` is its unique [Protein Databank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1olg) identifier."

    "Python has a wonderful keyword, `with`. This keyword enables **context management**. Upon entry into a `with` block, variables have certain meaning. In this case, the variable `f` has the meaning of an open file, an instance of the `_io.TextIOWrapper` class. Upon exit, certain operations take place. For file objects created by opening them, the file is automatically closed upon exit, **even if there is an error**. This is important. If your program raises an exception before you have a chance to close the file, it won't get closed and you could be in trouble. If you use context management, the file will still get closed.
