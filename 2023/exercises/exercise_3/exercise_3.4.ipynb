    "Sometimes you need to plot your data with a logarithmic scale. As an example, let's consider the classic genetic switch engineered by Jim Collins and coworkers ([Gardner, et al., *Nature*, **403**, 339, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/35002131)). This genetic switch was incorporated into *E. coli* and is inducible by adjusting the concentration of the lactose analog IPTG. The readout is the fluorescence intensity of GFP.\n",

    "The data set has the IPTG concentrations and GFP fluorescence intensity. The data are in the file `~/git/data/collins_switch.csv`. Let's look at it."

    "\n",
    "**b)** Now that you have done that, there are some problems with the plot. It is really hard to see the data points with low concentrations of IPTG. In fact, looking at the data set, the concentration of IPTG varies over four orders of magnitude. When you have data like this, it is wise to plot them on a logarithmic scale. You can specify the x-axis as logarithmic when you instantiate a figure with `bokeh.plotting.figure()` by using the `x_axis_type='log'` kwarg. (The obvious analogous kwarg applied for the y-axis.) For this data set, it is definitely best to have the x-axis on a logarithmic scale. Remake the plot you just did with the x-axis logarithmically scaled.\n",

    "1. Add columns `error_low` and `error_high` to the data frame containing the Collins data. These will set the bottoms and tops of the error bars. You should base the values in these columns on the standard error of the mean (`sem`). Assuming a Gaussian model, the 95% confidence interval is Â±1.96 times the s.e.m.\n",
    "2. Make a plot with the measured expression levels and the error bars. *Hint*: Check out the [Bokeh docs](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html) and think about what kind of glyph works best for error bars."
