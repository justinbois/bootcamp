Anonymous functions are typically only used when another function requires a function as an argument.

The `sorted()` function takes a `key` keyword argument that gives a function that is applied to each entry in the list and then the values returned by that function are used in the sorting. As an example, we can sort a list of names of goalscorers for LAFC in [the epic 2022 MLS Cup final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbeVQI5mPYk)."
