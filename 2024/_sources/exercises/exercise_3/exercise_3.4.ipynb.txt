As an example, let's consider the classic genetic switch engineered by Jim Collins and coworkers ([Gardner, et al., *Nature*, **403**, 339, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/35002131)).

It is really hard to see the data points with low concentrations of IPTG. In fact, looking at the data set, the concentration of IPTG varies over four orders of magnitude. When you have data like this, it is wise to plot them on a logarithmic scale. You can specify the x-axis as logarithmic when you instantiate a figure with `bokeh.plotting.figure()` by using the `x_axis_type='log'` kwarg. (The obvious analogous kwarg applied for the y-axis.) For this data set, it is definitely best to have the x-axis on a logarithmic scale. Remake the plot you just did with the x-axis logarithmically scaled.\n", "\n", "**c)** The data set also contains the standard error of the mean, or SEM.
