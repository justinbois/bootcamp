During this time, they have collected lots and lots of data about physiological features of finches.  In 2014, they published a book with a summary of some of their major results (Grant P. R., Grant B. R., *40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island*, Princeton University Press, 2014).

I have included the data in the files `grant_1973.csv`, `grant_1975.csv`, `grant_1987.csv`, `grant_1991.csv`, and  `grant_2012.csv`.

Are some birds counted twice? Are they counted twice in the same year? Do you think you should drop duplicate birds from the same year? How about different years? My opinion is that you should drop duplicate birds from the same year and keep the others, but I would be open to discussion on that. To practice your Pandas skills, though, let's delete only duplicate birds from the same year from the data frame. When you have made this data frame, save it as a CSV file.\n", "\n", "*Hint*: The data frame methods `duplicated()` and `drop_duplicates()` will be useful.\n", "\n", "After doing this work, it is worth saving your tidy data frame in a CSV document.
