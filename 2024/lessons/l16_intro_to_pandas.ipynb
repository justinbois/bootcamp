    "## The data set\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore using Pandas with a real data set. We will use a data set published in [Beattie, et al., Perceptual impairment in face identification with poor sleep, *Royal Society Open Science*, **3**, 160321, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160321). In this paper, researchers used the [Glasgow Facial Matching Test](https://doi.org/10.3758/BRM.42.1.286) (GMFT) to investigate how sleep deprivation affects a subject's ability to match faces, as well as the confidence the subject has in those matches. Briefly, the test works by having subjects look at a pair of faces. Two such pairs are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"margin: auto; width: 300px;\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "![GFMT faces](gfmt_faces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The top two pictures are the same person, the bottom two pictures are different people. For each pair of faces, the subject gets as much time as he or she needs and then says whether or not they are the same person. The subject then rates his or her confidence in the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, subjects also took surveys to determine properties about their sleep. The Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI) is a measure of insomnia disorder over the past month (scores of 16 and below indicate insomnia). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) quantifies how well a subject sleeps in terms of interruptions, latency, etc. A higher score indicates poorer sleep. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assesses daytime drowsiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is stored in the file `~/git/bootcamp/data/gfmt_sleep.csv`. The contents of this file were adapted from [the Excel file posted on the public Dryad repository](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r620r). (Note this: if you want other people to use and explore your data, make it publicly available.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **CSV file**, where CSV stands for comma-separated value. This is a text file that is easily read into data structures in many programming languages. You should generally always store your data in such a format, not necessarily CSV, but a format that is open, has a well-defined specification, and is readable in many contexts. Excel files do not meet these criteria. Neither to `.mat` files.\n",

Pandas has a very powerful function, `pd.read_csv()` that can read in a CSV file and store the contents in a convenient data structure called a **data frame**. In Pandas, the data type for a data frame is `DataFrame`, and we will use \"data frame\" and \"`DataFrame`\" interchangeably."

There are so many options we can specify for reading in a CSV file. You will likely find reasons to use many of these throughout your research. For this particular data set, we really only need the `na_values` kwarg. This specifies what characters signify that a data point is missing. The resulting data frame is populated with a **NaN**, or not-a-number, wherever this character is present in the file. In this case, we want `na_values='*'`. So, let's load in the data set."
