    "To explore another feature of `pytest`, we'll consider another aspect of our `number_negatives()` function. Specifically, what should we do if an invalid sequence is entered? A sensible thing to do in this case is to make our software throw a `RuntimeError`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, in designing our test, we need to think about what constitutes an invalid sequence. We'll only allow the 20 standard symbols for the residues that are present in the `bootcamp_utils.aa` dictionary. So, we adjust our test function accordingly. We cannot use the `assert` statement to check for proper error handling, so we use the `pytest.raises()` function. This function takes as its first argument the type of exception expected, and a string containing the code to be run to give the exception."

    "It is important to draw the distinction between assertions and raising exceptions in our code.  \n",

    "* We should raise **exceptions** when we are checking inputs to our function.  I.e., we are checking to make sure the user is using the function properly.\n",
    "* We should use **assertions** to make sure the function operates as expected for given input. This is almost always in a testing context.\n",

    "We also have to include `import pytest` at the beginning of the test file because we are using the `pytest.raises()` function. It is clear that if `Z` is passed as the input sequence, the program should throw a `RuntimeError` saying: *\"Z is an invalid sequence\"*. Let's test."

    "\n",
    "As we are building modules and functions, though we may try, we are not able to anticipate all the functionalities they must have. And by adding new functionalities, we might need to change our code substantially and even dramatically change the initial logic that worked so well up to this point. This is so common in programming that developers have a name for it: **code refactoring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we did not anticipate when we start writing `seq_features` that we also wanted to calculate the positive charges as well. Beyond that, we broke one of the most important rules in programming: **functions must do one thing and only one thing very well**. It is clear that `number_negatives()` was doing three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dealing with lowercases characters.  \n",
    "2. Raising exceptions for invalid amino-acids in the input sequence.  \n",
    "3. Calculating the negative charge of amino-acids.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that `number_positives()` also needs to do items 1 and 2, and because of that we have repeated the following lines of code in two different functions, within the same module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   # Convert sequence to upper case\n",
    "    seq = seq.upper()\n",
    "\n",

    "            raise RuntimeError(aa + ' is not a valid amino acid.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and if we are trying to make this module more robust, every time we catch a bug, we will need to change identical code in **two places**. So let's perform a code refactoring in order to keep the principle of *functions doing only one thing* as close to the truth as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task, changing the inputted sequence to uppercase, uses a built-in Python function, and using another function to do this is unnessary. So, we can keep the `seq = seq.upper()` line in the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's write a functions that will check if the sequence is valid. That way we will focus all the logic related to checking for invalid sequences in one part of the code, and we can call it anywhere we need afterwards. So, your module `seq_features.py` should look like this:\n",
