    "Before diving into the Python interpreter, I pause here to remind you that this programming bootcamp is not meant to teach Python syntax (though you will learn that). The things you learn here are meant to help you understand, and ultimately do, computer programming more generally. Think of it this way: this bootcamp is meant to help you unleash the power of your computer on your biological problems. Python is just the language of instruction. That said, let's start talking about how Python works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted language**, which means that each line of code you write is translated, or *interpreted*, into a set of instructions that your machine can understand by the **Python interpreter**. This stands in contrast to **compiled languages**.  For these languages (the dominant ones being Fortran, C, and C++), your entire code is translated into machine language before you ever run it. When you execute your program, it is already in machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whenever you want your Python code to run, you give it to the Python interpreter.\n",

    "There are many ways to launch the Python interpreter. One way is to type\n",

    "    python\n",

    "\n",
    "So, Jupyter is an extension of IPython the pushes interactive computing further. It is language agnostic as its name suggests.  The name \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a language for scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (which you know and love), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (the dominant tool for statistical computation).  However, you can run over 40 different languages in a JupyterLab, not just Julia, Python, and R.\n",

You can always import those modules when you are using a Jupyter notebook (more on modules and importing them later in the bootcamp). So, a Jupyter notebook is *not* a good for an application where you are building reusable code or scripts. However, Jupyter notebooks are **very** useful in the following applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Exploring data/analysis.* Jupyter notebooks are great for trying things out with code, or exploring a data set. This is an important part of the research process. The layout of Jupyter notebooks is great for organizing thoughts as you synthesize them.\n",
    "2. *Developing image processing pipelines.* This is really just a special case of (1), but it worth mentioning separately because Jupyter notebooks are especially useful when figuring out what steps are best for extracting useful data from images, which happens all-too-often in biology. Using the Jupyter notebook, you can write down what you hope to accomplish in each step of processing and then graphically show the results as images as you go through the analysis. We will do this later in the bootcamp.\n",
    "3. *Sharing your thinking in your analysis.* Because you can combine nicely formatted text and executable code, Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing how you go about doing your calculations with collaborators and with readers of your publications. Famously, LIGO used [a Jupyter notebook](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html) to explain the signal processing involved in their first discovery of a gravitational wave.\n",

Otherwise, you can can hit `Esc` and then `y` (denoted `Esc - y`\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell.  Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",

That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit `Shift + Enter` is the order in which the code is executed. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are not known to the Python interpreter. **This is a very important point and is often a source of confusion and frustration for students.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text. The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language. You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly. As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text. Hitting `Shift + Enter` renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",
