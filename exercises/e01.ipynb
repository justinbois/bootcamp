I was going to give you an exercise that uses the nuclear option, but I'm not going to do that.  So, just forget I said anything.  For this part of the problem, I want you to discuss with your neighbor *when* the nuclear option might be used, and what needs to be in place before exercising it."

We will represent the base pairs in dot-parentheses notation.  For example, a sequence/secondary structure pair would be\n",
