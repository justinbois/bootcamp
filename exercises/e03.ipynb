It is therefore useful to have a Python 2 distribution available if you want or need it.  `conda` makes this easy!  Follow the instructions in [Lesson 18](../lessons/l18_more_command_line.html#conda) to set up a Python 2 environment."

Specifically, the protein MEX-5 has a gradient in concentration from the anterior to the posterior part of the cytoplasm.

The anterior-to-posterior distance is 50 µm.\n",

In this problem, we not going to invstigate mechanism, but are interested in whether or not retarded diffusion can account for concentration gradients.  To answer this question, we will computationally perform random walks in the cytoplasm in which the step length changes depending on the position within the cell."

We we take the diffusion coefficient to be 1 µm$^2$/s, we can take steps of size $\\delta = 1$ µm with $\\tau = 1$ second.  The time scale of the formation of the MEX-5 gradient is about 1000 seconds, or about 15 minutes.
