    "## Problem 4.1: Setting up a GitHub account\n",
    "Having a local repository is useful, to be sure, but having a remote repository really brings you some power.  Importantly, it allows very easy sharing and logging of work done my many people.  Secondly, having a remote repository gets you extensive backups for free.  With the exceptions of presentations for talks, I do all of my work within Git repositories hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/), one of the most popular hosting services.  [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/) is another popular hosting service.\n",

    "In this problem, you will set up your own GitHub account and host the repo you set up for bootcamp there.  For the rest of bootcamp, you should keep your work under version control.\n",

    "*Note: you usually do not keep outputs of code under version control unless it serves as a basis for comparison for unit tests.  You also don't keep things you can't edit, like images, under version control.  The repositories can tend to get very large.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Go to the [GitHub website](http://github.com/) and set up an account.   Make sure you get an [academic account](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) that lets you have free private repositories and the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which gives you all sorts of goodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Follow the instructions [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github.html) to set up your first repository (bootcamp).  You will probably want this repository to be private.\n",

    "[Peter and Rosemary Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant) have been working on the Galápagos island of Daphne for over forty years.  During this time, they have collected lots and lots of data about physiological features of finches.  Last year, they published a book with a summary of some of their major results (Grant P. R., Grant B. R., *Data from: 40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island*, Princeton University Press, 2014). They made their data from the book publicly available via the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6g3h).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate their measurements of beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) and beak length (base to tip on the top) of Darwin's finches.  We will look at data from two species, *Geospiza fortis* and *Geospiza scandens*.  The Grants provided data on the finches of Daphne for the years 1973, 1975, 1987, 1991, and 2012.  You can download these files as they appear in the Dryad repo (though I changed file names and supplied a reference at the top of each file) [here](http://bois.caltech.edu/bootcamp/grant.zip)."

Do you think you should drop duplicate birds from the same year?  How about different years?  My opinion is that you should drop dupicate birds from the same year and keep the others, but I would be open to discussion on that.  To practice your Pandas skills, though, let's delete only duplicate birds from the same year from the `DataFrame`.  When you have make this `DataFrame`, save it as a CSV file.\n",

Neither the Uniprot webpage nor the associated NCBI protein webpages for the same sequence provide a direct link to the coding sequence.  Uniprot acknolwedges this issue but has no plans to change.
